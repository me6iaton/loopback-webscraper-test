The company has made an announcement at the <a href=\\\"http://www.barclaysaccelerator.com/\\\">Barclays Accelerator</a> demo event on Monday.</p>\\n<p>“Safello and Barclays will be working together on creating a new payment platform that will support bitcoins. The collaboration begins with a PoC trial to allow for donations to be sent to charities using Bitcoins,” said Safello co-founder and chief exective officer Frank Schuil.</p>\\n<p>Under the project, together with Safello, Barclays will investigate how the digital currency technology can change the sector of financial services. They are going to start a PoC trial for sending donations with the use of bitcoin. Currently, the platform is in the early design stages.</p>\\n<p>Safello joined Barclays’ 13-week financial technology accelerator program this March. Started last year, the program appeared to be very successful. Of all the 10 companies participating in the program, 7 extended their partnership with the bank.</p>\\n<p>At the event, the startups unveiled what they achieved during the program and described the progress they made. During three months, ome firms even managed to create their technologies from an idea to product development.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=27502\\\">Finextra</a> notes that Post Quantum signed a deal to implement its cyber security technology at Barclays. Stock trading game platform Stockfuse is going to become a part of the bank’s graduate recruitment campaign by launching a Global Market Insight Game this year.</p>\\n<p>Barclays Accelerator is a program of networking, mentoring and development that was designed to help fintech startups improve their businesses and support innovations in the sector. The program shows that Barclays actively supports the developing world fintech segment.</p>\\n<p>Barclays Chief Design Officer Derek White said: “At Barclays, we’re embracing the digital revolution,

I would not say that the market is stagnant by any stretch of the imagination but if I were to construct a trading metaphor I would call it a garden; both bears and bulls have been mulched into trade fodder as the market barrels where it will. The market range bounds have been the most frustrating part of the current trading condition, though fortunately the short term technicals have returned to a more pronounced and controlled model (this is really, really good for more predictable trading and otherwise). When there is a situation change like this it is an indication that a new higher price equilibrium is on the way and this would indicate there will be another part to the current upside trend after price consolidation.

The site was shut down and Micon fled to Antigua with his family where he promptly opened a new Bitcoin poker room – SWCPoker.</p>\\n<p>While in Antigua, a warrant was issued in Nevada for Micon’s arrest. The Bitcoin poker boss took to social media to indicate a desire to fight the allegation, claiming he had done nothing wrong.</p>\\n<p>Micon also asked the poker-playing public for support in attempting to stave off the court action, with a goal of raising $100,000 for costly attorney fees. A GoFundMe account was established, but reached only around $4,000 in donations before the site stopped accepting donations for reasons not fully explained.</p>\\n<p>The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Micon plans to appear in court for his next court date. Through his attorney it was learned that the warrant for Micon’s arrest has been recalled, allowing him to travel and arrive in Clark County, Nevada and present himself voluntarily. Indications are that he will be booked and released, apparently willing to cooperate in answering this court call and any appearance dates in the future.</p>\\n<p>During the raid on his Las Vegas home four months ago, the authorities confiscated computers and electronic equipment. Micon’s online footprints were recovered, revealing that he once attempted to contact the operator of Lock Poker in hopes of acquiring that U.S.-friendly site.</p>\\n<p>Lock Poker has since stopped operating, with an estimated $15 million still owed to players.

The B wave now seems to be completing a subwave “c” to the upside. Addtional waves “d” and “e” may unfold, thereby drawing trade sideways into a MA sell signal. <strong>Or wave “c” may push higher toward the green Fib line directly above $248</strong>.</p>\\n<p>The prospect of additional decline is still alive, and <strong>breaking below $240 and 1490CNY will confirm a downside wave</strong> and activate our Trade Recommendation.</p>\\n<p>Recognizing that we are only dealing with probabilities, and not certainties, there is also the probability that the market becomes satisfied with the test of $240 and decides to trade price higher. On that outcome there is massive resistance at $256 and 1590CNY – the level of the descending daily 200MA.</p>\\n<p><em>Analysis at 16h00 UTC</em></p>\\n<p>The current wave is noodling out an advancing path that made a high, earlier, at <strong>$248</strong>.

A part of this low price action could have been caused by OKCoin, the Chinese Bitcoin exchange that went offline for a brief time following a database issue. But we still hope traders were able to churn out decent profits from the levels we suggested in our previous analysis.</p>\\n<p>As we enter another day of trading, with Asian session in play and UK being just started, we can surely hope to see price attempting yet another breakout — towards either level. Let’s check out the price action:</p>\\n<h2><b>Bitcoin 4H Chart</b></h2>\\n\\n<p>Over the last few days, Bitcoin is bouncing between a predefined 245.61-241.04 range, with 245.61 being the in-term resistance and 241.04 being the in-term support level. As the price action continues further, we are seeing Bitcoin respecting the same range, while looking for a breakout amid speculations of Greece buyout — which I personally think to be a hoax, but consider for the sake of considering.</p>\\n<p>We will therefore be recommending you to avoid betting against the unseen odds. The technical indicators in 4H BitFinex above are definitely showing Bitcoin in a neutral bias, for the price, however being above its 50, 100, and 200H SMA, is still facing a notable selling pressure near the range resistance line. The RSI and MACD indicators further demonstrates the moderate selling pressure in the market, with their curves going downwards since the correcting chopping started last Thursday.</p>\\n<p>Bitcoin, for now, is looking to cross above the in-term resistance level, a move that would validate 249.47 as its primary upside target. It surely opens some decent long opportunities, if you risk to place your bet at current levels (near 244 at press time), but make sure to place your</p><p>Originally appeared at: <a href=\\\"http://www.forexminute.com/technical-analysis-reports/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range-60267\\\">http://www.forexminute.com/technical-analysis-reports/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range-60267</a></p><a href=\\\"http://www.zazzle.com/btcwarrior\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><img src=\\\"//bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BW-Gear-Banner-copy1.png\\\"></a>\\n<div class=\\\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\\\"><div class=\\\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\\\"><h3 class=\\\"sd-title\\\">Share this:</h3><div class=\\\"sd-content\\\"><ul><li class=\\\"share-reddit\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=reddit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Reddit\\\"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-facebook\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-facebook-11951\\\" class=\\\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=facebook\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Share on Facebook\\\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-twitter\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-twitter-11951\\\" class=\\\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=twitter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Twitter\\\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-tumblr\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=tumblr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Tumblr\\\"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-google-plus-1\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-google-11951\\\" class=\\\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=google-plus-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Google+\\\"><span>Google</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-stumbleupon\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-stumbleupon sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=stumbleupon\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on StumbleUpon\\\"><span>StumbleUpon</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-linkedin\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-linkedin-11951\\\" class=\\\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=linkedin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on LinkedIn\\\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pinterest\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-pinterest-11951\\\" class=\\\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=pinterest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pinterest\\\"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pocket\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-pocket sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=pocket\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pocket\\\"><span>Pocket</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-email\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-email sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/?share=email\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to email this to a friend\\\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-print\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-print sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/cryptocurrency-trading-news-low-weekend-volatility-keeps-bitcoin-in-range/#print\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to print\\\"><span>Print</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-end\\\"></ul></div></div></div> </div>\",\"published\":\"2015-06-22T08:48:35+00:00\"},\"id\":14}",

With a plethora of available options like SnapScan, MobileMe, cellphone banking, online shopping and the rapid emergence of Bitcoin on the continent (the City of Cape Town just launched its first dedicated Bitcoin hub – Bithub), it has never been easier to live cashless. Now the Danish government has proposed that by next year, it would like all of Denmark to be completely cashless. Scandinavians already rely on cash for less than 6% of all payments made (in contrast to the US, where about 47% of all payments are still made with cash). But this might not be good news for everyone. Digital transactions come with many fraud and security risks, while the elderly and marginalised groups have limited access to electronic-payment options. </p>\\n<p><strong>CAPE TOWN CHARGES AHEAD</strong></p>\\n<p>Cape Town will soon be home to the first roll-out in South Africa of charging points for electric cars if plans by BMW and Nissan go ahead. The two motoring giants decided to join forces after waiting for more than three years for Gauteng to deliver on its promise to install 50 fast-charging points across the province. The adoption of the electric car has been slow in South Africa because the infrastructure for the car’s operation hasn’t been available to car owners.</p>\\n<p><strong>THE R5-SIZED FLASH DRIVE</strong></p>\\n<p>This week, tech conglomerate Sandisk introduced the world’s smallest storage device – a 128GB USB flash drive the size of a R5 coin.

Well, alright, perhaps that isn’t true. But banks reciprocate that by not feeling so rosy about everyone, either. Most banks make money by offering loans and collecting interest, which means they need people to repay those loans. If a bank gives out too many loans that aren’t repaid, they’ll eventually go out of business, just like the mortgage crisis of the late 2000’s. To manage their risk, banks have tools like credit scores to evaluate loan applicants, classifying them as prime or <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_lending\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">subprime</a>, with subprime applicants having poor or limited credit; that’s why the last banking crisis is often called the “Subprime Crisis.” Banks exist to make money, so of course banks seek to loan as much money as possible to the most qualified loanees. So who services unqualified or less-qualified loanees who may only need microfinance loans? What other niche markets are underserved by the banking industry, and can Bitcoin capture this business?</p>\\n<p>Banks traditionally seek to serve prime borrowers, equating to people with credit scores over 700, income of at least $75,000, and a significant credit history. That leaves a significant portion of the population outside of their target market. Industry research has termed consumers that do not handle all their financial needs through banks as “underserved,” as noted by Kevin Tynan in an <a href=\\\"http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/why-community-banks-should-be-courting-the-underserved-1069863-1.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">article</a> penned for <a href=\\\"http://www.americanbanker.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">www.americanbanker.com</a>. The underserved population is more often seeking purely digital banking options, and tend to stay away from traditional checking and savings accounts, preferring prepaid cards or money orders.

I guess the answer will be “every time”. That shouldn’t come as a surprise as search engines like <a href=\\\"http://www.google.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.bing.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Bing</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.search.yahoo.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Yahoo</a> etc. track user’s location and browsing data to show relevant advertisements. Now that they have your data, what stops them from using that data for purposes other than advertising? Nothing (except for few privacy laws)!</p>\\n<p>It is no doubt that the search engine giant has enough data available to profile everyone depending upon their interests and search patterns combined with other publicly available information to guess who the person really is. But what about others, the people without access to Google’s big data regarding its users? They can do some exciting things too, even when it comes to profiling the kind of people who are interested in the pseudonymous digital currencies like Bitcoin and that’s exactly what a couple of researchers did recently.</p>\\n<p>Bitcoin is known for the anonymous nature of transactions. Even though Bitcoin transactions can be tracked easily, the identity of the person or people who are parties to the transactions usually remains undisclosed. Then how did these two researchers identify a Bitcoin user’s profile? Well, they used Google, or <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/trends/?hl=en\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Google Trends</a> data to be more specific.</p>\\n<p>These University of Kentucky duo – <a href=\\\"http://www.yelowitz.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Dr. Aaron Yelowitz</a> and <a href=\\\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2322863\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Matthew Wilson</a> conducted statistical analysis of Google Trends data to find the pattern.

The company has recently announced the first leg of its workshop series. The workshop series is part of the company’s educational outreach tour.</p>\\n<p>Starting early this week, the company will begin conducting workshops in Istanbul, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Prague, Berlin and London. Anyone interested in the Bitcoin technology can just walk in and attend the workshop.</p>\\n<p>Even though there are many people who are interested in Blockchain technology, they are holding back due to lack of expertise in the domain. The workshop series is named #StartingBlock2015 and it is organized in association with Blockchain Space. Developers and enthusiasts can attended the event free of charge, except for the Istanbul event, scheduled to happen at the “<a href=\\\"http://www.fitstartupfactory.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fit Start-up Factory</a>” on 24 June, 2015. These events are deliberately kept free of charge to encourage more developers to try this new technology.</p>\\n<p>The complete schedule of the workshop is available in detail on the BlockStrap <a href=\\\"http://blockstrap.com/en/blog/announcing-european-startingblock-2015-tour/\\\">webpage</a>.

A collection agency seeking an unpaid medical bill, a discovery request in a divorce or lawsuit, and under certain circumstances the police […] may be able to access your medical bills. While bitcoin is not anonymous, it can be completely private when purchasing anything including medical services.”</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Patients at clinics with BitMD partnerships have options. If they already own bitcoins, they can make a simple payment at the counter using one of BitMD’s tablets (or any device running the wallet software). If they don’t own bitcoins, patients can either purchase them with cash using the BTM, or buy them with a swipe of their credit card using the POS terminal.</p>\\n<p>The movement of cryptocurrency into medicine has been markedly slower than other industries – like tech – but notable stories have headlined in the past year, including Seattle’s Bitcoin-accepting <a href=\\\"http://cointelegraph.com/news/113437/bitcoin-friendly-cannabis-vending-machines-makes-historic-debut-in-seattle\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">marijuana vending machine</a> and BTC</p><p>Originally appeared at: <a href=\\\"http://cointelegraph.com/news/114626/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin\\\">http://cointelegraph.com/news/114626/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin</a></p><a href=\\\"http://www.zazzle.com/btcwarrior\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><img src=\\\"//bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BW-Gear-Banner-copy1.png\\\"></a>\\n<div class=\\\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\\\"><div class=\\\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\\\"><h3 class=\\\"sd-title\\\">Share this:</h3><div class=\\\"sd-content\\\"><ul><li class=\\\"share-reddit\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=reddit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Reddit\\\"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-facebook\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-facebook-11926\\\" class=\\\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=facebook\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Share on Facebook\\\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-twitter\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-twitter-11926\\\" class=\\\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=twitter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Twitter\\\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-tumblr\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=tumblr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Tumblr\\\"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-google-plus-1\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-google-11926\\\" class=\\\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=google-plus-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Google+\\\"><span>Google</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-linkedin\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-linkedin-11926\\\" class=\\\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=linkedin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on LinkedIn\\\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pinterest\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-pinterest-11926\\\" class=\\\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=pinterest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pinterest\\\"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pocket\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-pocket sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=pocket\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pocket\\\"><span>Pocket</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-email\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-email sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/?share=email\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to email this to a friend\\\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-print\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-print sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitmd-enables-clinics-to-accept-patient-payments-in-bitcoin/#print\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to print\\\"><span>Print</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-end\\\"></ul></div></div></div> </div>\",\"published\":\"2015-06-21T14:29:43+00:00\"},\"id\":24}",

After bouncing at the 50 percent retracement level yesterday, prices rallied to a high of $249.08. This is approximately close to the 23.6 Fibonacci level. It’s also close to the important $250 mark. We have since fallen back somewhat with BTC/USD currently quoted at $244.83. OKCoin was down at the time this article was written so I can’t give an update on their prices.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://i0.wp.com/bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/plugins/RSSPoster_PRO/cache/6b529_jun20.png\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone wp-image-347604\\\" src=\\\"//i0.wp.com/bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/plugins/RSSPoster_PRO/cache/6b529_jun20.png?resize=538%2C300\\\" alt=\\\"jun20\\\" data-recalc-dims=\\\"1\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>The rally will remain in place until the support near $230 dollars gives way. For OKCoin this corresponds to $227 dollars. But to continue the momentum higher, BTC will need to break this week’s high at $257 dollars ($259 OKCoin). There is resistance level close to here, so a better breakout point is $259 on BTC-E and $263 on OKCoin. More resistance can be found at $270 and $300. Of these two, the round $300 figure is a triple top that ended two previous BTC rallies. A breakout above it could exacerbate the gains. For OKCoin this level was at $305.</p>\\n<p>Note that the OKCoin levels apply to the exchange platform, not futures. Futures contracts tend to have higher price oscillations and varying degrees of premium/discount based on the date of delivery and the current trend. For example, at the time of yesterday’s <a href=\\\"http://www.forexnews.com/blog/2015/06/20/bitcoin-nears-50-percent-retracement/\\\">snapshot</a>, the main exchange was trading at <span id=\\\"0_last_price_u\\\" class=\\\"usdPrice\\\">$239.26</span> while the June 26th contract was trading at <a href=\\\"https://www.okcoin.com/future/market.do?symbol=0\\\">$241.54.</a> Meanwhile the far out September 25th contract was quoting prices over $3 dollars higher compared to spot at $242.89. In the last four days we’ve seen this premium trade as high as $9 dollars.</p>\\n<p>During strong trends to the upside you’ll</p><p>Originally appeared at: <a href=\\\"http://www.forexnews.com/blog/2015/06/21/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/\\\">http://www.forexnews.com/blog/2015/06/21/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/</a></p><a href=\\\"http://www.zazzle.com/btcwarrior\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><img src=\\\"//bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BW-Gear-Banner-copy1.png\\\"></a>\\n<div class=\\\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\\\"><div class=\\\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\\\"><h3 class=\\\"sd-title\\\">Share this:</h3><div class=\\\"sd-content\\\"><ul><li class=\\\"share-reddit\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=reddit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Reddit\\\"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-facebook\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-facebook-11923\\\" class=\\\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=facebook\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Share on Facebook\\\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-twitter\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-twitter-11923\\\" class=\\\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=twitter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Twitter\\\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-tumblr\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=tumblr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Tumblr\\\"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-google-plus-1\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-google-11923\\\" class=\\\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=google-plus-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Google+\\\"><span>Google</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-stumbleupon\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-stumbleupon sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=stumbleupon\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on StumbleUpon\\\"><span>StumbleUpon</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-linkedin\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-linkedin-11923\\\" class=\\\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=linkedin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on LinkedIn\\\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pinterest\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-pinterest-11923\\\" class=\\\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=pinterest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pinterest\\\"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pocket\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-pocket sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=pocket\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pocket\\\"><span>Pocket</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-email\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-email sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/?share=email\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to email this to a friend\\\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-print\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-print sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-still-in-pullback-mode/#print\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to print\\\"><span>Print</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-end\\\"></ul></div></div></div> </div>\",\"published\":\"2015-06-21T08:26:48+00:00\"},\"id\":26}",

There is a critical bullish trend line formed on the 4-hours chart, which is likely to act as a barrier for sellers if the price moves lower from the current levels. The price closed around the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the 219.00 low to 257.00 high, which is also coinciding with the Lower Bollinger Band. There is a chance of a spike lower towards the highlighted bullish trend line, i.e. positioned with the 50% Fib retracement level. So, there is a major support forming around 240.00 where buyers might put up a fight.</p>\\n<p><strong>Trend Line Break </strong></p>\\n<p>A break below the highlighted trend line could ignite more losses in the near future. However, there is one more support building around 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There are a couple of bearish signs emerging on the 4-hours chart, including the fact that the RSI is below the 50 level. Plus, the MACD has changed the slope to bearish to help sellers moving ahead.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://i2.wp.com/www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bitcoin4.png\\\"><img class=\\\"alignnone

The absence of divergence implies decline can continue unhindered. However, all indicators are at oversold troughs in their range and the reverse divergence at the 4-hour timeframe has compounded. Given these conditions we’d expect an upward reaction in price – perhaps to the level of the descending 1hr 20MA around <strong>$245-$247</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Once price has attained this level and the indicators give signals implying a turn back down, it may be time to take a short trade. Below the 200MA there are targets at <strong>$234</strong> (1hr 800MA and 1.618 Fib extension), $230 (a magnetic line target, courtesy of KiwiOz’s method) and $222 (2.618 Fib extension).</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Be aggressive in a trending market and conservative in a choppy market. –</p><p>Originally appeared at: <a href=\\\"https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-price-bounces-support-2/\\\">https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-price-bounces-support-2/</a></p><a href=\\\"http://www.zazzle.com/btcwarrior\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><img src=\\\"//bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BW-Gear-Banner-copy1.png\\\"></a>\\n<div class=\\\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\\\"><div class=\\\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\\\"><h3 class=\\\"sd-title\\\">Share this:</h3><div class=\\\"sd-content\\\"><ul><li class=\\\"share-reddit\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=reddit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Reddit\\\"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-facebook\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-facebook-11920\\\" class=\\\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=facebook\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Share on Facebook\\\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-twitter\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-twitter-11920\\\" class=\\\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=twitter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Twitter\\\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-tumblr\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=tumblr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Tumblr\\\"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-google-plus-1\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-google-11920\\\" class=\\\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=google-plus-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Google+\\\"><span>Google</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-stumbleupon\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-stumbleupon sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=stumbleupon\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on StumbleUpon\\\"><span>StumbleUpon</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-linkedin\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-linkedin-11920\\\" class=\\\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=linkedin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on LinkedIn\\\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pinterest\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-pinterest-11920\\\" class=\\\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=pinterest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pinterest\\\"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pocket\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-pocket sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=pocket\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pocket\\\"><span>Pocket</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-email\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-email sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/?share=email\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to email this to a friend\\\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-print\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-print sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-price-bounces-from-support/#print\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to print\\\"><span>Print</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-end\\\"></ul></div></div></div> </blockquote></div>\",\"published\":\"2015-06-21T02:10:01+00:00\"},\"id\":28}",

But increased mining costs and processing power requirements have led to the creation of few large Bitcoin mining pools run by data centres belonging to companies which invite people to invest in these centres for a small share of rewards in bitcoin.</p>\\n<p>Mining is an important operation in the Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin mining is responsible for registering and verifying transactions on the Blockchain. Mining operation requires a lot of processing power, which makes it more energy intensive. The processing power is now supplied by special hardware known as <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)</a>. Theses ASICs are developed specially for mining Bitcoin.</p>\\n<p>Increase in the number of bitcoins and bitcoin transactions is progressively increasing mining difficulty. As the difficulty increases, the need for processing power increases which in turn translates to increased energy requirements and costs. The unit prices for electricity from conventional sources is high which makes Bitcoin mining using independent rigs at homes uneconomical, thereby effectively discouraging individual miners. However, it is good news for Bitcoin mining companies who choose to set up their data centres in places with access to alternative energy to reduce energy costs and maximise profits by taking over a large chunk of mining.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to costs, electricity from renewable sources is cheaper compared to other conventional sources. Currently, the electricity production using renewable sources is confined to harnessing wind and solar energy. While wind turbines have become more efficient in converting wind energy into electricity, the solar panels (photovoltaic cells/solar cells) still needs to improve. Even though the rate of energy conversion is not as much as we wish for it to be, solar panels can</p><p>Originally appeared at: <a href=\\\"http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/06/20/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/\\\">http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/06/20/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/</a></p><a href=\\\"http://www.zazzle.com/btcwarrior\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><img src=\\\"//bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BW-Gear-Banner-copy1.png\\\"></a>\\n<div class=\\\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\\\"><div class=\\\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\\\"><h3 class=\\\"sd-title\\\">Share this:</h3><div class=\\\"sd-content\\\"><ul><li class=\\\"share-reddit\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=reddit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Reddit\\\"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-facebook\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-facebook-11918\\\" class=\\\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=facebook\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Share on Facebook\\\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-twitter\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-twitter-11918\\\" class=\\\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=twitter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Twitter\\\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-tumblr\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=tumblr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Tumblr\\\"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-google-plus-1\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-google-11918\\\" class=\\\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=google-plus-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Google+\\\"><span>Google</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-stumbleupon\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-stumbleupon sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=stumbleupon\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on StumbleUpon\\\"><span>StumbleUpon</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-linkedin\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-linkedin-11918\\\" class=\\\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=linkedin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on LinkedIn\\\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pinterest\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-pinterest-11918\\\" class=\\\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=pinterest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pinterest\\\"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pocket\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-pocket sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=pocket\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pocket\\\"><span>Pocket</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-email\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-email sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/?share=email\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to email this to a friend\\\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-print\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-print sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/#print\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to print\\\"><span>Print</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-end\\\"></ul></div></div></div> </div>\",\"published\":\"2015-06-21T02:09:57+00:00\"},\"id\":30}",

This huge debt and interest is totally unsustainable for Greece to maintain and Greece has no more to give. This could mean Greece exclusion from the Eurozone.</p>\\n<p>Would it be a good idea for Greece to renounce the euro and adopt bitcoin? This would mean giving up their sovereign monetary policy. However, the finance minister of Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, believes that because Bitcoin is deflationary, it would be bad for Greece.</p>\\n<p>Monetary policy, used responsibly, is useful to manage public finances, provided it is not abused to issue too much currency. Greece cannot itself use monetary policy whilst it is part of the eurozone and adopting bitcoin would position Greece in the exact same position.</p>\\n<p>Varoufakis goes on saying that bitcoin is a flawed currency because it is deflationary. And that’s where he misses the point.  Bitcoin is deflationary with a fixed amount of regular issuance controlled by the bitcoin software algorithm. The amount in issue today is around 14m and the total amount that can ever be issued is capped at 21m and this is not going to change ever.</p>\\n<p>It would probably be better for the country to consider adopting the bitcoin open source protocol to create its own government-backed national cryptocurrency with the Greek central bank and its national banks acting as validators with a pre-mined amount of the national currency equivalent to the amount of euros held in Greek banks. In addition, a small percentage should be pre-mined and distributed equally to each Greek valid social security number taxpayer.</p>\\n<p>If the Greek government issued</p><p>Originally appeared at: <a href=\\\"http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/06/19/could-bitcoin-become-greece-official-currency/\\\">http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/06/19/could-bitcoin-become-greece-official-currency/</a></p><a href=\\\"http://www.zazzle.com/btcwarrior\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\"><img src=\\\"//bitcoinwarrior.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BW-Gear-Banner-copy1.png\\\"></a>\\n<div class=\\\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\\\"><div class=\\\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\\\"><h3 class=\\\"sd-title\\\">Share this:</h3><div class=\\\"sd-content\\\"><ul><li class=\\\"share-reddit\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-reddit sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=reddit\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Reddit\\\"><span>Reddit</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-facebook\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-facebook-11914\\\" class=\\\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=facebook\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Share on Facebook\\\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-twitter\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-twitter-11914\\\" class=\\\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=twitter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Twitter\\\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-tumblr\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-tumblr sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=tumblr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Tumblr\\\"><span>Tumblr</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-google-plus-1\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-google-11914\\\" class=\\\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=google-plus-1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Google+\\\"><span>Google</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-stumbleupon\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-stumbleupon sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=stumbleupon\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on StumbleUpon\\\"><span>StumbleUpon</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-linkedin\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-linkedin-11914\\\" class=\\\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=linkedin\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on LinkedIn\\\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pinterest\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"sharing-pinterest-11914\\\" class=\\\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=pinterest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pinterest\\\"><span>Pinterest</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-pocket\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-pocket sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=pocket\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to share on Pocket\\\"><span>Pocket</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-email\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-email sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/?share=email\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to email this to a friend\\\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-print\\\"><a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" data-shared=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"share-print sd-button share-icon\\\" href=\\\"http://bitcoinwarrior.net/2015/06/could-bitcoin-become-greeces-official-currency/#print\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Click to print\\\"><span>Print</span></a></li><li class=\\\"share-end\\\"></ul></div></div></div> </div>\",\"published\":\"2015-06-20T20:09:33+00:00\"},\"id\":32}",

However DigitalOcean it's accessible and reliable. I made the switch from AWS to DO and was very happy, a $5/mo plan it's a $5/mo plan with more power and more features (as your VPS it's very customizable) than AWS, period. If you want even more power for your money I'd recommend you use Vultr instead of DigitalOcean though (I'm using them right now). They're the same deal that DO (accessible/reliable/no hidden costs) but they also give you more specs (RAM/SSD, etc); for less money. At DO images are \\\"as vanilla\\\" as they can but Vultr even lets you upload your own ISO's and perform really custom installations, (besides having SATA storage options  if you need lots of space and not exactly the speeds of a ssd); but the interface it's \\\"uglier\\\" compared to the DO one though.\\n\\npermalinksavereportgive goldreply\",\"[–]Mackseraner 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (0 children)I am really enjoying deploying to Digital Ocean Dokku droplets.

A lot of configuration settings can be set in VC and then pivoted based on an environment variable.

And whether one likes it or not, express is still application logic. NODE_ENV is beyond whatever logic you run using Node.js. It should be much equivalent to environment variables in e.g. Java.\\nI am not debating conditional behavior (\\\"getting\\\"), as you introduce with your above example. Behavior depending on environment is hard to avoid. Perhaps unavoidable in larger applications. However, you merely illustrate a usage example for the environment variable. This has nothing to do with setting or overriding said variable.\\nYour reference to Doug Wilson's argument brings nothing new to the table, I'm afraid. He doesn't provide arguments why it is or is not considered good practice to set the env in application logic. And frankly, neither do you.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe code you are intending to run in production should be the safest and most conservative.\\n\\n\\nThe logic in this statement is flawed when used as an argument in this context. It does not take into account a wrongful change of the target environment. This comment references conditional behavior, as mentioned previously. Not a prior change to the variable (setting or overriding).\\n\\nOf course I agree with the statement. Everyone - I assume - would want their production code to function flawlessly. However, for a developer, it is not acceptable to accidentally target your production database from a development or test environment. Only production should target production. The above statement does not embrace this very problem.\\n\\nIn my eyes, people should manually set up the NODE_ENV on their own machines with the a fitting value, e.g. \\\"production\\\", \\\"development\\\", or \\\"test\\\".\\n\\npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]paperelectron 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)\\nIn my eyes, people should manually set up the NODE_ENV on their own machines with the a fitting value, e.g. \\\"production\\\", \\\"development\\\", or \\\"test\\\".\\n\\n\\nYes we are 100% in agreement there. However you may want to take it up with the express devs, because from the viewpoint of your express application, they are already overriding your lack of a NODE_ENV variable into an unsafe default. Why aren't you telling them how unsafe this is? I'm simply pointing out that 'production' is safer, and we are all in agreement that throwing on the missing env is the safest.\\n\\npermalinksaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]MostlyCarbonite -1 points0 points1 point 13 hours ago (2 children)I'm pretty mystified by the downvotes  on your comment and mine. paperelectron can only point to one instance of defaulting to prod (which seems to have something to do with security) yet every tutorial/sample that I see is defaulting to dev.

I used to do the same with my previous apps that I have built, but if you are deploying to the cloud its always better to store the config values in the environment.\\n\\nThis way you are consciously setting up values in your dev or production environment. http://12factor.net/config this site has great information about developing and deploying regardless of the language or platform. And I agree whole heartedly about storing the config values in the environment. We are using this library https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config for managing our configuration setup for the app.\\n\\nUse the dev or production env only to setup stuff like verbose logging of any tool or library you are using in the project and nothing else.
