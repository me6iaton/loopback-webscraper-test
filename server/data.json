As the price action continues further, we are seeing Bitcoin respecting the same range, while looking for a breakout amid speculations of Greece buyout — which I personally think to be a hoax, but consider for the sake of considering.\\nWe will therefore be recommending you to avoid betting against the unseen odds. The technical indicators in 4H BitFinex above are definitely showing Bitcoin in a neutral bias, for the price, however being above its 50, 100, and 200H SMA, is still facing a notable selling pressure near the range resistance line. The RSI and MACD indicators further demonstrates the moderate selling pressure in the market, with their curves going downwards since the correcting chopping started last Thursday.\\nBitcoin, for now, is looking to cross above the in-term resistance level, a move that would validate 249.47 as its primary upside target.

With a plethora of available options like SnapScan, MobileMe, cellphone banking, online shopping and the rapid emergence of Bitcoin on the continent (the City of Cape Town just launched its first dedicated Bitcoin hub – Bithub), it has never been easier to live cashless. Now the Danish government has proposed that by next year, it would like all of Denmark to be completely cashless. Scandinavians already rely on cash for less than 6% of all payments made (in contrast to the US, where about 47% of all payments are still made with cash). But this might not be good news for everyone. Digital transactions come with many fraud and security risks, while the elderly and marginalised groups have limited access to electronic-payment options. \\nCAPE TOWN CHARGES AHEAD\\nCape Town will soon be home to the first roll-out in South Africa of charging points for electric cars if plans by BMW and Nissan go ahead. The two motoring giants decided to join forces after waiting for more than three years for Gauteng to deliver on its promise to install 50 fast-charging points across the province. The adoption of the electric car has been slow in South Africa because the infrastructure for the car’s operation hasn’t been available to car owners.\\nTHE R5-SIZED FLASH DRIVE\\nThis week, tech conglomerate Sandisk introduced the world’s smallest storage device – a 128GB USB flash drive the size of a R5 coin.

But banks reciprocate that by not feeling so rosy about everyone, either. Most banks make money by offering loans and collecting interest, which means they need people to repay those loans. If a bank gives out too many loans that aren’t repaid, they’ll eventually go out of business, just like the mortgage crisis of the late 2000’s. To manage their risk, banks have tools like credit scores to evaluate loan applicants, classifying them as prime or subprime, with subprime applicants having poor or limited credit; that’s why the last banking crisis is often called the “Subprime Crisis.” Banks exist to make money, so of course banks seek to loan as much money as possible to the most qualified loanees. So who services unqualified or less-qualified loanees who may only need microfinance loans? What other niche markets are underserved by the banking industry, and can Bitcoin capture this business?\\nBanks traditionally seek to serve prime borrowers, equating to people with credit scores over 700, income of at least $75,000, and a significant credit history. That leaves a significant portion of the population outside of their target market. Industry research has termed consumers that do not handle all their financial needs through banks as “underserved,” as noted by Kevin Tynan in an article penned for www.americanbanker.com. The underserved population is more often seeking purely digital banking options, and tend to stay away from traditional checking and savings accounts, preferring prepaid cards or money orders.

But increased mining costs and processing power requirements have led to the creation of few large Bitcoin mining pools run by data centres belonging to companies which invite people to invest in these centres for a small share of rewards in bitcoin.\\nMining is an important operation in the Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin mining is responsible for registering and verifying transactions on the Blockchain. Mining operation requires a lot of processing power, which makes it more energy intensive. The processing power is now supplied by special hardware known as ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). Theses ASICs are developed specially for mining Bitcoin.\\nIncrease in the number of bitcoins and bitcoin transactions is progressively increasing mining difficulty. As the difficulty increases, the need for processing power increases which in turn translates to increased energy requirements and costs. The unit prices for electricity from conventional sources is high which makes Bitcoin mining using independent rigs at homes uneconomical, thereby effectively discouraging individual miners. However, it is good news for Bitcoin mining companies who choose to set up their data centres in places with access to alternative energy to reduce energy costs and maximise profits by taking over a large chunk of mining.\\nWhen it comes to costs, electricity from renewable sources is cheaper compared to other conventional sources. Currently, the electricity production using renewable sources is confined to harnessing wind and solar energy. While wind turbines have become more efficient in converting wind energy into electricity, the solar panels (photovoltaic cells/solar cells) still needs to improve. Even though the rate of energy conversion is not as much as we wish for it to be, solar panels canOriginally appeared at: http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/06/20/bitcoin-mining-may-soon-turn-eco-friendly/\\nShare this:RedditFacebookTwitterTumblrGoogleStumbleUponLinkedInPinterestPocketEmailPrint\",\"published\":\"2015-06-21T02:09:57+00:00\"},\"id\":30}",

This fact makes it possible for New York to attempt to claim jurisdiction to enforce regulations.\\nWhether or not BTC Guild could win in defense of such an attempt is irrelevant, since the cost of defending the pool would be greater than any income the pool is expected to generate going forward.”\\n\\nSimilarly, Eobot explained to their members who use New York IP addresses that the mining pool could no longer afford to deal with them:\\n\\n“The new BitLicense requirements in this state place compliance and cost burdens upon Eobot that we believe are excessive.”\\n\\nLastly, after declaring a block of New York IPs, the online exchange ShapeShift.io cited that BitLicense is actually dangerous to consumers, gathering their personal data into “honeypots” to be hacked. ShapeShift’s founder even started a website, PleaseProtectConsumers, which encourages companies to join him in refusing BitLicense compliance.\\nHave Things Gone Terribly Wrong, or Precisely Right?\\nBusiness licensing laws always hit the smaller guys first and hardest — but only if they’re “aboveboard.” This means using banks, government IDs, and business licenses — being “legally documented,” so to speak.

This huge debt and interest is totally unsustainable for Greece to maintain and Greece has no more to give. This could mean Greece exclusion from the Eurozone.\\nWould it be a good idea for Greece to renounce the euro and adopt bitcoin? This would mean giving up their sovereign monetary policy. However, the finance minister of Greece, Yanis Varoufakis, believes that because Bitcoin is deflationary, it would be bad for Greece.\\nMonetary policy, used responsibly, is useful to manage public finances, provided it is not abused to issue too much currency. Greece cannot itself use monetary policy whilst it is part of the eurozone and adopting bitcoin would position Greece in the exact same position.\\nVaroufakis goes on saying that bitcoin is a flawed currency because it is deflationary. And that’s where he misses the point.  Bitcoin is deflationary with a fixed amount of regular issuance controlled by the bitcoin software algorithm. The amount in issue today is around 14m and the total amount that can ever be issued is capped at 21m and this is not going to change ever.\\nIt would probably be better for the country to consider adopting the bitcoin open source protocol to create its own government-backed national cryptocurrency with the Greek central bank and its national banks acting as validators with a pre-mined amount of the national currency equivalent to the amount of euros held in Greek banks. In addition, a small percentage should be pre-mined and distributed equally to each Greek valid social security number taxpayer.\\nIf the Greek government issuedOriginally appeared at: http://www.newsbtc.com/2015/06/19/could-bitcoin-become-greece-official-currency/\\nShare this:RedditFacebookTwitterTumblrGoogleStumbleUponLinkedInPinterestPocketEmailPrint\",\"published\":\"2015-06-20T20:09:33+00:00\"},\"id\":32}",
